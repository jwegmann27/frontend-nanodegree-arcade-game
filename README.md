==================================================

frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game is the third project of my Udacity front end web developer nanodegree. 
The purpose of this game was to learn object oreinted javascript. 

How to use code?
****************
Step #1 - To use the code you first have to locate a file named index.html which is in the github repository called frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game. 

Step #2 - When you locate the file called index.html, you can then right click the file then go to open with. When your mouse is over the open with option you can then select the internet browser you'd like to open the program with. If you don't see the open with option when you right click index.html try to first left click the file name then right click to bring up the options as before. 

Step #3 - If you have done the first two steps correctly a page will open that will contain the game. 

How to play the game?
*********************
- To control the player use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. These keys will move the player around the board.

- The rules of the game are simple, if you make it to the water without hitting the bugs you win. If you hit the bugs on the way to the water you will be reset and have to start all over. Good Luck!
